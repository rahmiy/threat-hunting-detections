## Query

```kusto
#event_simpleName=ProcessRollup2
| ImageFileName = /(powershell\.exe|pwsh\.exe)$/i
| CommandLine = /(Register-ScheduledTask|New-ScheduledTaskAction|New-ScheduledTask|Set-ScheduledTask)/i

## Notes

- This query is written for CrowdStrike Falcon LogScale (formerly Humio)
- `ProcessRollup2` is the standard CrowdStrike event for process creation
- Covers both `powershell.exe` and `pwsh.exe` to catch Windows PowerShell and PowerShell 7
- The regex covers all four common PowerShell scheduled task registration cmdlets in a single expression
- `ParentBaseFileName` surfaces the parent process for additional triage context
- PowerShell Script Block Logging (Event ID 4104) can provide additional visibility into obfuscated task registration attempts
- Field names may vary across tenants — adjust as necessary for your environment
- Review results against known administrative baselines before alerting
