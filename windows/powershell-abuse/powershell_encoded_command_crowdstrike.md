## Query

```kusto
#event_simpleName=ProcessRollup2
| ImageFileName = /(powershell\.exe|pwsh\.exe)$/i
| CommandLine = /(-EncodedCommand|-EncodedC|-EncodC|-enc|-ec)\s/i
| table(_time, ComputerName, UserName, ImageFileName, CommandLine, ParentBaseFileName)
| sort(field=_time, order=desc)
```

## Notes

- This query is written for CrowdStrike Falcon LogScale (formerly Humio)
- `ProcessRollup2` is the standard CrowdStrike event for process creation
- The regex covers all common abbreviations of the encoded command flag in a single pattern
- `ParentBaseFileName` surfaces the parent process for additional triage context
- Field names may vary across tenants — adjust as necessary for your environment
- In large environments computer accounts (ending in `$`) may generate significant volume from legitimate management tooling such as SCCM, Group Policy, and automation frameworks — baseline which specific computer accounts are expected to run encoded commands and exclude those rather than excluding all computer accounts broadly
- Computer accounts running encoded PowerShell should not be dismissed as automatically benign — when malware or a malicious scheduled task runs as SYSTEM, network authentication goes out under the computer account, making these events worth investigating
- Review results against known administrative baselines before alerting
