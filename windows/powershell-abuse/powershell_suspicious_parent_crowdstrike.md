## Query

```kusto
#event_simpleName=ProcessRollup2
| ImageFileName = /(powershell\.exe|pwsh\.exe)$/i
| ParentBaseFileName = /(winword\.exe|excel\.exe|powerpnt\.exe|outlook\.exe|mshta\.exe|wscript\.exe|cscript\.exe)$/i
| table(_time, ComputerName, UserName, ImageFileName, CommandLine, ParentBaseFileName)
| sort(field=_time, order=desc)
```

## Notes

- This query is written for CrowdStrike Falcon LogScale (formerly Humio)
- `ProcessRollup2` is the standard CrowdStrike event for process creation
- The regex covers all suspicious parent processes from the hunt document in a single clean expression
- Office application parent processes spawning PowerShell should be treated as high priority and investigated immediately
- `ParentBaseFileName` surfaces the parent process for additional triage context
- Field names may vary across tenants — adjust as necessary for your environment
- Review results against known administrative baselines before alerting
