## Query 1 — Rundll32 Loading DLLs from Non-Standard Paths

This query detects rundll32 invocations referencing DLL files in non-standard locations such as temporary directories, user profile paths, or other user-writable locations. Legitimate rundll32 usage typically involves DLL files in System32 or standard application directories.

```kusto
#event_simpleName=ProcessRollup2
| ImageFileName = /rundll32\.exe$/i
| CommandLine = /(\\temp\\|\\tmp\\|\\appdata\\|\\programdata\\|\\users\\)/i
| table(@timestamp, ComputerName, UserName, ImageFileName, CommandLine, ParentBaseFileName)
| sort(field=@timestamp, order=desc)
```

## Query 2 — Rundll32 LSASS Memory Dump via Comsvcs.dll

This query detects rundll32 invocations referencing comsvcs.dll alongside the MiniDump function or ordinal 24 — a well documented credential access technique used to dump LSASS memory. Any occurrence of this pattern should be treated as a critical alert.

```kusto
#event_simpleName=ProcessRollup2
| ImageFileName = /rundll32\.exe$/i
| CommandLine = /comsvcs/i
| CommandLine = /(MiniDump|#24)/i
| table(@timestamp, ComputerName, UserName, ImageFileName, CommandLine, ParentBaseFileName)
| sort(field=@timestamp, order=desc)
```

## Query 3 — Rundll32 Executing Script Content

This query detects rundll32 invocations associated with JavaScript or COM scriptlet execution through mshtml.dll or similar mechanisms.

```kusto
#event_simpleName=ProcessRollup2
| ImageFileName = /rundll32\.exe$/i
| CommandLine = /(mshtml|javascript|\.sct)/i
| table(@timestamp, ComputerName, UserName, ImageFileName, CommandLine, ParentBaseFileName)
| sort(field=@timestamp, order=desc)
```

## Query 4 — Rundll32 Spawned by Suspicious Parent Process

This query detects rundll32 spawned by parent processes commonly associated with phishing-based initial access including Office applications and scripting engines.

```kusto
#event_simpleName=ProcessRollup2
| ImageFileName = /rundll32\.exe$/i
| ParentBaseFileName = /(winword\.exe|excel\.exe|powerpnt\.exe|outlook\.exe|mshta\.exe|wscript\.exe|cscript\.exe|explorer\.exe)/i
| table(@timestamp, ComputerName, UserName, ImageFileName, CommandLine, ParentBaseFileName)
| sort(field=@timestamp, order=desc)
```

## Notes

- This query is written for CrowdStrike Falcon LogScale (formerly Humio)
- `ProcessRollup2` is the standard CrowdStrike event for process creation
- Query 2 targets the comsvcs.dll MiniDump technique specifically — both the function name and ordinal 24 are included as attackers sometimes use the ordinal to avoid string matching
- `explorer.exe` is included as a parent process in Query 4 but may generate more noise than the other parent processes listed — can be removed if volume is too high in your environment
- `ParentBaseFileName` surfaces the parent process for additional triage context
- Field names may vary across tenants — adjust as necessary for your environment
- Review results against known administrative baselines before alerting
