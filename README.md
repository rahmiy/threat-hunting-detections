## Overview

This repository serves as my professional portfolio for threat hunting, detection engineering, and adversary tradecraft analysis.

It contains:

- Vendor-agnostic detection rules (Sigma)
- Platform-specific detection queries (Splunk, KQL, CrowdStrike)
- Documented threat hunting investigations
- Intel-driven hunts based on real-world threat reporting
- Technical research and detection methodology

The goal of this project is to translate real-world attacker behavior into actionable detection logic across enterprise security platforms.

Each topic folder contains:
- A research paper covering the threat landscape and attacker tradecraft
- A hunt document with hypotheses and detection guidance
- Platform-specific queries (Splunk, CrowdStrike, KQL where applicable)
- Sigma rules for vendor-agnostic detection coverage

> **Note:** This repository was restructured in September 2026 to improve navigation. If you previously bookmarked direct links to specific files those links may need to be updated.

## Methodology

My workflow typically follows this progression:

**Standard Hunts:**
Research → Hunt Document → CrowdStrike → Splunk → KQL → Sigma

**Intel Hunts:**
Threat Intelligence Report → Hunt Document → CrowdStrike → Splunk → KQL → Sigma

Where possible, detections are:

- Mapped to MITRE ATT&CK techniques
- Tested against real telemetry
- Converted across multiple platforms

---

## Purpose

This repository demonstrates practical capability in:

- Writing detection logic across multiple SIEM and EDR platforms
- Investigating suspicious telemetry and building hunt hypotheses
- Translating threat reports into actionable detections
- Building platform-specific security content at scale

It serves as both a technical portfolio and a foundation for future professional consulting or product development.
