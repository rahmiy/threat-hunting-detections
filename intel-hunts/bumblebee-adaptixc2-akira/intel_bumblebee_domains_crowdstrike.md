## Query

```kusto
#event_simpleName=DnsRequest
| DomainName = /(ev2sirbd269o5j\.org|2rxyt9urhq0bgj\.org|d1hmxkpwby0d4s\.org|yj6jurm5qqkye5\.org|ewujsfb1dp5ran\.org|8doj8uvx604eck\.org|kwywztxoo2xdot\.org|ky1d1p1daahe5t\.org|ovh1kn1tcqw5kp\.org|6cimu4mc085em8\.org|5ka8rxp6t6eup2\.org|ks501oz9nm3v05\.org|v5rjsdqogstopr\.org)/i

## Notes

- This query is written for CrowdStrike Falcon LogScale (formerly Humio)
- `DnsRequest` is the standard CrowdStrike event for DNS query telemetry
- DNS events do not record a destination IP — `FirstIP4Record` and `FirstIP6Record` contain the resolved IP addresses from the DNS answer and are used instead
- These domains are associated with BumbleBee Wave 2 DGA infrastructure observed in this campaign
- IOC fidelity decays over time — these domains may no longer be active or associated with malicious infrastructure depending on when this search is run
- Always validate IOCs against current threat intelligence before using for alerting
- Field names may vary across tenants — adjust as necessary for your environment
