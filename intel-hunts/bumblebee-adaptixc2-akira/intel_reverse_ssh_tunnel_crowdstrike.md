## Query

```kusto
#event_simpleName=ProcessRollup2
| ImageFileName = /ssh\.exe$/i
| CommandLine = /\s-R\s/i
| table(@timestamp, ComputerName, UserName, ImageFileName, CommandLine, ParentBaseFileName)
| sort(field=@timestamp, order=desc)
```

## Notes

- This query is written for CrowdStrike Falcon LogScale (formerly Humio)
- `ProcessRollup2` is the standard CrowdStrike event for process creation
- The regex matches the `-R` flag with surrounding whitespace to avoid partial matches on other SSH arguments
- The `-R` flag indicates a reverse port forward — legitimate administrative use of this flag is rare on production systems
- Review the full command line for external IP addresses and port numbers to understand the tunnel destination
- `ParentBaseFileName` surfaces the parent process for additional triage context
- Field names may vary across tenants — adjust as necessary for your environment
- Review results against known administrative baselines before alerting
