## Query

```kusto
#event_simpleName=ProcessRollup2
| ImageFileName = /wbadmin\.exe$/i
| CommandLine = /(ntds\.dit|start\s+backup)/i
| table(@timestamp, ComputerName, UserName, ImageFileName, CommandLine, ParentBaseFileName)
| sort(field=@timestamp, order=desc)
```

## Notes

- This query is written for CrowdStrike Falcon LogScale (formerly Humio)
- `ProcessRollup2` is the standard CrowdStrike event for process creation
- The regex matches both explicit ntds.dit references and the start backup argument
- This activity is rarely legitimate outside of approved domain controller backup operations — any hit outside of a known maintenance window should be treated as high priority
- `ParentBaseFileName` surfaces the parent process for additional triage context
- Field names may vary across tenants — adjust as necessary for your environment
- Review results against known administrative baselines before alerting
