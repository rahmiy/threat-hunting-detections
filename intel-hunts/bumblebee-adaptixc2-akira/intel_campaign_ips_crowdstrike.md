## Notes

- This query is written for CrowdStrike Falcon LogScale (formerly Humio)
- `NetworkConnectIP4` is the standard CrowdStrike event for outbound network connections
- `ContextBaseFileName` identifies the process making the outbound connection — UserName and ImageFileName are not available in network connect events
- IOC fidelity decays over time — these IPs may no longer be associated with malicious infrastructure depending on when this search is run
- Always validate IOCs against current threat intelligence before using for alerting
- Field names may vary across tenants — adjust as necessary for your environment
