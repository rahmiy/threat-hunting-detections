## Query

```kusto
#event_simpleName=ProcessRollup2
| event_platform=Lin
| ImageFileName = /\/shred$/i
| CommandLine = /(\/var\/log\/|\.bash_history)/i
| table(@timestamp, ComputerName, UserName, ImageFileName, CommandLine, ParentBaseFileName)
| sort(field=@timestamp, order=desc)
```

## Notes

- This query is written for CrowdStrike Falcon LogScale (formerly Humio)
- `event_platform=Lin` filters results to Linux endpoints only
- `ProcessRollup2` is the standard CrowdStrike event for process creation across all platforms
- The query is scoped to shred activity targeting log files and bash history files specifically to reduce noise from legitimate use of shred against other files
- `ParentBaseFileName` surfaces the parent process for additional triage context
- Shred used against log files or history files has very few legitimate explanations and should be treated as high priority when detected
- Field names may vary across tenants — adjust as necessary for your environment
- Review results against known administrative baselines before alerting
