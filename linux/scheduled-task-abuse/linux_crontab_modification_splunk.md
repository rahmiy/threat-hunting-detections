index=linux sourcetype="linux_audit" OR sourcetype="syslog"
Image="*/crontab"
(
    CommandLine="*crontab -e*" OR

    CommandLine="*crontab -l*"
)
| table _time, host, user, CommandLine, ParentCommandLine
| sort -_time
```

## Notes

- Adjust index and sourcetype values to match your environment
- Common Linux log sourcetypes include `linux_audit`, `syslog`, `linux_secure`, and `auditd` — adjust based on your Splunk configuration
- Auditd is recommended as the primary data source for Linux process execution telemetry as it provides richer command-line visibility than syslog alone
- Pay particular attention to crontab modifications on servers and cloud workloads where interactive user activity is not expected
- The `-l` flag lists existing crontab entries and can generate significant noise in most environments — consider removing it and focusing on `-e` and `-r` only to reduce unwanted results
- Field names for Linux logs may differ significantly from Windows logs — adjust based on your specific log source and parsing configuration
- Review results against known administrative baselines before alerting
